In this case, civil society may fill the void as one of those partners which can play a crucial role in bringing voices together under common platforms to make a strong case for quality education. </p>
                    <p>The Namibian Education Coalition for Civil Society Organisations (NECCSO) was officially launched on 6 September 2011 at the Inaugural General Assembly by approximately 40 founding member civil society organisations. NECCSO is a network of civil society stakeholders in education or which have a keen interest in educational matters in terms of policy development, policy implementation, policy monitoring and service delivery. NECCSO asserts that the contribution of a broad-based and coordinated civil society is instrumental for achieving relevant inclusive quality education for all.</p>

                        <p>NECCSO had the challenging tasks to coordinate civil society inputs into the National Education Conference of June 2011 while in its infancy. Initially, it was intended to formally launch NECCSO just before National Education Conference but it was tactically agreed to delay formal launch to maximize all energies towards stronger civil society influence at this historic national gathering on education.</p>
                        <p>The initial work of the Steering Committee and the activities leading up to the formal launch was financially supported by the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (OSISA) through the ANCEFA Regional Office for Southern Africa in Lusaka with a grant of approximately U$25 000 during 2011 and 2012. As a follow up to this partnership, NECCSO was successful in getting a further grant from OSISA for the Budget Advocacy Project towards the end of 2012.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after its launch, NECCSO engaged in partnership with Ministry of Education and UNICEF and other civil society actors and the Social Accountability in Education and School Governance Project was initiated out of this partnership. This project that formerly started at the beginning of 2012 was preceded by a “National Workshop on Governance and Accountability in the Education Sector – a civil society perspective”.</p>
                        <p>NECCSO also collaborated with the Urban Trust of Namibia for the implementation of a UNICEF supported project aimed at developing an advocacy issues paper for safer and violence free schools in Namibia. Two consultative meetings were held in December 2013 and February 2014 with key stakeholders to discuss the draft advocacy issues paper drafted with technical assistance by the Centre for Justice and Crime Prevention based in Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
                        <p>The launching General Assembly of NECCSO on 6 September 2011 tasked the incoming leadership to finalise a Strategic Plan. Based on the framework provided by the General Assembly, a draft Strategic Plan framework was designed and shared with various stakeholders for inputs and for initiating partnership discussions. The final strategic plan was discussed and approved by various Board meetings in January and April 2014.</p>

                                        recommendations from this workshop was that a project be initiated to improve accountability 
                                        within the education sector by ensuring increase stakeholder-community involvement in

                                    <h2>Review of the Education Act</h2>
                                    <p>Namibia Education Coalition for Civil Society Organizations (NECCSO) received a grant of 
                                        50,000.00 US Dollars from Open Society Initiative of South Africa to run a project on an 
                                        advocacy campaign for amendments to the Education Act of 2001. Additional funding to the 
                                        value of N$ 100,000.00 was obtained from NAMPOWER to boost the project.</p>
                                        <p>The need for NECCSO to fully partake in this initiate emanated from the need by various 
                                            organisations involved in the education sector, including the civil society which have observed 
                                            that the Education Act No. 16 of 2001 had serious shortcomings in addressing issues in 
                                            education properly. This had wide-ranging implications as there was no legal basis for many 
                                            of the policies that the Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture (MoEAC) wanted to implement. 
                                            It has also emerged that the Ministry would first make amendments to the Act if they wanted 
                                            to pass a specific policy.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                                <div class="frame2_heading">
                                    <p>This made the Education Act No. 16 of 2001 of Namibia burdened 
                                        with more amendments than the actual Act itself. Researchers always had to have a copy of 
                                        amendments and the Act if they wanted to interpret the Act or policies.</p>
                                        <p>In light of the above mentioned the Ministry of Education has embarked upon a campaign to 
                                            amend Education Act No. 16 of 2001. This exercise was initiated by the Ministry through the 
                                            appointment of a consultant supported by UNICEF. It was also imperative that a National 
                                            Steering Committee be appointed which comprised of all stakeholders in education. NECCSO 
                                            was part of this National Steering Committee. Although NECCSO was part of this committee, NECCSO was convinced that the civil society consultations should be conducted parallel to 
                                            the national consultations and submit a position paper to the Ministry in order to ensure that 
                                            pertinent issues should either be addressed as part of the new act or in the guidelines and 
                                            regulations of the Act. NECCSO therefore obtained support from OSISA to initiate this 
                                            process. Therefore, the overall goal of the project was to undertake a review on the 
                                            implementation of the current Education Act, undertake consultations and produce a civil 
                                            society position paper targeting the Ministry of Education and law makers.</p>

                                    <p>In 2013 UNESCO, with support from SIDA-NORAD, initiated a regional programme across 
                                        Eastern and Southern African (ESA) countries to strengthen sexual and reproductive health 
                                        and HIV prevention amongst children and young people through promoting Comprehensive 
                                        Sexuality Education (CSE).</p>
                                        <p>In order to ensure full support for comprehensive sexuality education there was an urgent need 
                                            to engage with and address the concerns of key gatekeepers at the state and community level, 
                                            from policy makers to the religious community to garner their support in the creation of an 
                                            enabling environment for the provision of CSE.</p>

                                        <li>To increase capacity of key players in the education sector to plan, manage and monitor comprehensive sexuality education at all levels of the school system.</li>
                                        <li>To strengthen the quality of CSE curricula to ensure they are evidence-based, gender transformative and age-and culturally-appropriate.</li>
                                        <li>To strengthen the implementation of CSE curricula through the development of a confident and well trained workforce.</li>

                                    <p>UNESCO recognises the importance of involving parents and community members when 
                                        addressing a complex issue such as sexuality education. The involvement of parent 
                                        associations, community and religious leaders in the planning process can increase 
                                        understanding and support for the programmes as parents, guardians and community 
                                        gatekeepers understand the benefits of sexuality education for children and young people. Well 
                                        planned communication between schools, parents, Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture and 
                                        the community through the media, parents’ meetings and public meetings can be a useful tool 
                                        to build support and ensure coherence between the messages and attitudes being taught in 
                                        school and what young people learn from home.</p>

                                        CSOs in different countries, including Namibia were trained in the utilisation of the toolkit, to

After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either party is entitled.</p>

<p><strong>Arbitration Rules.</strong> Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.  If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.  The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.  The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.  If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00.  Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</strong> If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.  The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p>

<p><strong>Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>

<p><strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.</p>

<p><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.  Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.  In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>

<p><strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user.</p>

<p><strong>Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be strictly confidential.  The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.  This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>

<p><strong>Severability.</strong> If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

<p><strong>Right to Waive.</strong> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Survival of Agreement.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.</p>

<p><strong>Small Claims Court.</strong> Nonetheless the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>

<p><strong>Emergency Equitable Relief.</strong> Anyhow the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.  A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

<p>In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Netherlands County, California, for such purposes.</p>
